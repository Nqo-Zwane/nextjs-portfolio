# The Manqoba Zwane Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases my journey as an **Entrepreneurial Software Engineer**. Here, you‚Äôll find a blend of my skills, experience, and projects, with a special focus on **web development**, **GSAP animations**, and design elements inspired by **Malvah Studio**.

The website is built using **Next.js** with TypeScript for added reliability and scalability. I‚Äôve used **GSAP** to bring animations to life, offering a smooth, interactive experience. Throughout this project, I‚Äôve aimed to balance both creativity and performance.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building fast, scalable web applications with built-in SEO and SSR (Server-Side Rendering) support.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability through static typing.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A high-performance animation library to create complex animations with ease.
- **Styled Components**: Writing CSS in JavaScript for scoped, modular styling.
- **ESLint**: For ensuring code quality and identifying potential issues.
- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting for consistency.
- **Husky**: Ensures code quality by running checks on staged files before committing.
- **SEO Optimised**: The project includes strategies for search engine optimization.
- **SSR Ready**: The application is configured to leverage Server-Side Rendering for fast initial loads.

## üñåÔ∏è Styling & Animations

The styling is done using **Styled Components**, which are generated at build time for better performance and served through **Server-Side Rendering**. The fonts and styles are optimised for fast rendering, including the use of **Google Fonts (Poppins)**.

**GSAP animations** are used extensively throughout the site to create smooth transitions and engaging visuals. These animations help deliver a high-quality user experience and bring the design to life.
